Crystal structure determination at 1.4 A resolution of ferredoxin from the green alga Chlorella fusca.
BACKGROUND:
[2Fe-2S] ferredoxins, also called plant-type ferredoxins, are low-potential redox proteins that are widely distributed in biological systems. In photosynthesis, the plant-type ferredoxins function as the central molecule for distributing electrons from the photolysis of water to a number of ferredox-independent enzymes, as well as to cyclic photophosphorylation electron transfer. This paper reports only the second structure of a [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin from a eukaryotic organism in its native form.
RESULTS:
Ferredoxin from the green algae Chlorella fusca has been purified, characterised, crystallised and its structure determined to 1.4 A resolution - the highest resolution structure published to date for a plant-type ferredoxin. The structure has the general features of the plant-type ferredoxins already described, with conformational differences corresponding to regions of higher mobility. Immunological data indicate that a serine residue within the protein is partially phosphorylated. A slightly electropositive shift in the measured redox potential value, -325 mV, is observed in comparison with other ferredoxins.
CONCLUSIONS:
This high-resolution structure provides a detailed picture of the hydrogen-bonding pattern around the [2Fe-2S] cluster of a plant-type ferredoxin; for the first time, it was possible to obtain reliable error estimates for the geometrical parameters. The presence of phosphoserine in the protein indicates a possible mechanism for the regulation of the distribution of reducing power from the photosynthetic electron-transfer chain.
