The genome sequence of Yaba-like disease virus, a yatapoxvirus.
The genome sequence of Yaba-like disease virus (YLDV), an unclassified member of the yatapoxvirus genus, has been determined. Excluding the terminal hairpin loops, the YLDV genome is 144,575 bp in length and contains inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of 1883 bp. Within 20 nucleotides of the termini, there is a sequence that is conserved in other poxviruses and is required for the resolution of concatemeric replicative DNA intermediates. The nucleotide composition of the genome is 73% A+T, but the ITRs are only 63% A+T. The genome contains 151 tightly packed open reading frames (ORFs) that either are > or =180 nucleotides in length or are conserved in other poxviruses. ORFs within 23 kb of each end are transcribed toward the termini, whereas ORFs within the central region of the genome are encoded on either DNA strand. In the central region ORFs have a conserved position, orientation, and sequence compared with vaccinia virus ORFs and encode many enzymes, transcription factors, or structural proteins. In contrast, ORFs near the termini are more divergent and in seven cases are without counterparts in other poxviruses. The YLDV genome encodes several predicted immunomodulators; examples include two proteins with similarity to CC chemokine receptors and predicted secreted proteins with similarity to MHC class I antigen, OX-2, interleukin-10/mda-7, poxvirus growth factor, serpins, and a type I interferon-binding protein. Phylogenic analyses indicated that YLDV is very closely related to yaba monkey tumor virus, but outside the yatapoxvirus genus YLDV is more closely related to swinepox virus and leporipoxviruses than to other chordopoxvirus genera.
