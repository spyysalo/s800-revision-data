Identification of the abundant neuropeptide from abdominal perisympathetic organs of locusts.
The first member of the periviscerokinin peptide family in Locusta migratoria was identified by post-source decay fragmentation on a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer using a single neurohemal organ only. The primary sequence of this decapeptide, code-named Lom-PVK, is Ala-Ala-Gly-Leu-Phe-Gln-Phe-Pro-Arg-Val-NH(2). Unlike the situation in cockroaches, Lom-PVK is the only abundant periviscerokinin in L. migratoria. It is present in abdominal perisympathetic organs of various species of locusts and grasshoppers. Its myotropic properties, namely to increase the frequency of the contraction of the heart in L. migratoria and stimulate amplitude and tonus of the locust foregut, is reminiscent of the action of Periplaneta-PVKs.
