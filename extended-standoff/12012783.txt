The primary structure of hemoglobin D from the Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea.
The complete primary structures of alpha D-2- and beta-globin of hemoglobin D (Hb D) from the Aldabra giant tortoise, Geochelone gigantea, have been constructed by amino acid sequencing analysis in assistance with nucleotide sequencing analysis of PCR fragments amplified using degenerate oligonucleotide primers. Using computer-assisted sequence comparisons, the alpha D-2-globin shared a 92.0% sequence identity versus alpha D-globin of Geochelone carbonaria, a 75.2% versus alpha D-globin of Aves (Rhea americana) and a 62.4% versus alpha A-globin of Hb A expressed in adult red blood cells of Geochelone gigantea. Additionally, judging from their primary structures, an identical beta-globin was common to the two hemoglobin components, Hb A and Hb D. The alpha D-2- and beta-globin genes contained the three-exon and two-intron configurations and showed the characteristic of all functional vertebrate hemoglobin genes except an abnormal GC dinucleotide instead of the invariant GT at the 5' end of the second intron sequence. The introns of alpha D-2-globin gene were both small (224-bp/first intron, 227-bp/second intron) such that they were quite similar to those of adult alpha-type globins; the beta-globin gene has one small intron (approximately 130-bp) and one large intron (approximately 1590-bp). A phylogenetic tree constructed on primary structures of 7 alpha D-globins from Reptilia (4 species of turtles, 2 species of squamates, and 1 species of sphenodontids) and two embryonic alpha-like globins from Aves (Gullus gullus) and Mammals (Homo sapiens) showed the following results: (1) alpha D-globins except those of squamates were clustered, in which Sphenodon punctatus was a closer species to birds than turtles; (2) separation of the alpha A- and alpha D-globin genes occurred approximately 250 million years ago after the embryonic alpha-type globin-genes (pi' and zeta) first split off from the ancestor of alpha-type globin gene family.
