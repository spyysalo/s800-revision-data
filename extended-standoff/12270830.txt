Differential expression of two catechol 1,2-dioxygenases in Burkholderia sp. strain TH2.
Burkholderia sp. strain TH2, a 2-chlorobenzoate (2CB)-degrading bacterium, metabolizes benzoate (BA) and 2CB via catechol. Two different gene clusters for the catechol ortho-cleavage pathway (cat1 and cat2) were cloned from TH2 and analyzed. Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis showed that while both catechol dioxygenases (CatA1 and CatA2) were produced in BA-grown cells, CatA1 was undetectable when strain TH2 was grown on 2CB or cis,cis-muconate (CCM), an intermediate of catechol degradation. However, production of CatA1 during growth on 2CB or CCM was observed when cat2 genes were disrupted. The difference in the production of CatA1 and CatA2 was apparently due to a difference in inducer recognition by the regulators of the gene clusters. The inducer of CatA1 was found to be BA, not 2CB, by using a 2-halobenzoate dioxygenase gene (cbd) disruptant, which is incapable of transforming (chloro)benzoate. It was also found that CCM or its metabolite acts as an inducer for CatA2. When cat2 genes were disrupted, the growth rate in 2CB culture was reduced while that in BA culture was not. These results suggest that although cat2 genes are not indispensable for growth of TH2 on 2CB, they are advantageous.
