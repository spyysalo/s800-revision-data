Sequence characterization and expression of the matrix protein gene of human parainfluenza virus type 1.
The nucleotide sequence of the M gene of human parainfluenza virus type 1 (hPIV1) was determined from genomic RNA and cDNA copies of the entire gene. The M gene contained 1173 nucleotides. It had one large open reading frame capable of encoding a protein of 348 amino acids (M(r) = 38,404). The predicted amino acid sequence of the hPIV1 M protein is highly basic (+20 at neutral pH). A pGEM-1 expression vector containing the M gene was used for cell-free transcription and translation. The resultant protein was confirmed to be M by electrophoretic mobility and immunoprecipitation. Among other paramyxoviridae the hPIV1 M amino acid sequence was most closely related to the Sendai virus M sequence (87% identity). The pattern of M gene relatedness observed from the alignment of 16 paramyxoviridae M protein amino acid sequences was not predicted by the viruses' taxonomic classification.
