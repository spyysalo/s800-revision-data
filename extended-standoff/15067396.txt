Identification and isolation of lectin nucleotide sequences and species relationships in the genus Lens Miller.
Genes for lectin, a component of legume storage proteins, were identified and characterised in two lentil cultivars ( Lens culinaris ssp. culinaris) and six wild relatives. In each taxon no differences were found among the two or three lectin clones sequenced, while differences were observed among lectin genes isolated from the different taxa. All of the clones analysed contained an insert of 828 bp and showed a high similarity with the nucleotide sequence of Pisum sativum seed lectin, PSL1. The deduced amino acid lectin sequences in all taxa were 275 amino acids long, and their multiple alignment showed that most of the variation among them occurred in regions which are not important for metal- and sugar-binding. The data from Southern blot analysis indicated the presence of only one lectin gene in all Lens taxa except L. tomentosus. Phylogenetic analyses carried out on the lectin sequences showed the existence of two main clusters and clearly indicated that L. nigricans falls outside the two groups.
