Heat shock Hsp70 protein is chloroplast-encoded in the chromophytic alga Pavlova lutherii.
Heat shock proteins are ubiquitous and highly conserved. Recently they have become implicated in the import of proteins into organelles. All the heat shock genes characterized to date, however, are known or assumed to be encoded in the nuclear genome even if the corresponding protein can be localised in the mitochondrion or chloroplast. In contrast, we identify here an hsp70 gene in the unicellular chromophytic alga Pavlova lutherii which is located on the chloroplast genome. Localisation of this gene to the chloroplast chromosome is confirmed by Southern blot analysis and pulse-field gel electrophoresis which also reveals that the length of the P. lutherii chloroplast chromosome is 115 kb. We compare the predicted protein of this hsp70 gene with that of maize and of the analogous proteins in the prokaryotic organisms Escherichia coli and Synechocystis PCC6803. The greatest identity is found with the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC6803.
