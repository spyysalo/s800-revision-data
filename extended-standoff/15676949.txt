The effect of alternative product-label design on warning compliance.
Many potentially hazardous products are packaged in small containers. Because of the limited amount of space available on these containers for warnings and other information, manufacturers often reduce the size and amount of printed material on the labels. This frequently impairs the message's legibility, noticeability and comprehensibility. Recently, several alternative label designs have been investigated using preference ratings, but whether the designs facilitate safer behaviour has not been determined. In the present experiment, two alternative designs (tag and wings) were compared with a conventional (control) design for their effect on behavioural compliance with a warning on a very small container of glue. Participants performed a parts-assembly task using the glue without being informed of the study's real purpose. Whether participants wore protective gloves as directed by the warning was measured. Results showed that the tag design produced significantly greater compliance than the other two designs. Measures of noticing, reading and recall of the warning mirrored the compliance results. While participants generally preferred the control label, they most preferred the tag warning. Overall, the results suggest that alternative designs like the tag can enhance warning communication and compliance in cases where surface area is limited.
