Primary structures of neuropeptides isolated from the corpora cardiaca of various cetonid beetle species determined by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing and tandem fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
A peptide with the same retention time on gradient reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography was present in the corpora cardiaca of 5 scarabaeid beetles, subfamily Cetoniinae: the three fruit beetle species Pachnoda marginata, P. sinuata and P. aemulae and the two protea beetle species Trichostetha fascularis and T. albopicta. Crude corpora cardiaca material from P. sinuata had a small hypertrehalosaemic effect in American cockroaches and a very weak hyperlipaemic activity in migratory locusts. Injections into P. sinuata caused hypertrehalosaemia when a dose of 1.0 corpora cardiaca equivalents was injected. An identical neuropeptide was isolated, by RP-HPLC, and sequenced by pulsed-liquid phase sequencing employing Edman chemistry after enzymically deblocking the N-terminal 5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid residue, as well as by collision-induced decomposition tandem fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. The peptide is a blocked octapeptide: Glu-Leu-Asn-Tyr-Ser-Pro-Asp-TrpNH2, previously designated Mem-CC. The synthetic peptide is able to elicit haemolymph carbohydrates in P. sinuata upon injection of low doses. Activity studies using synthetic analogues of this peptide revealed that Tyr4 may be important for receptor recognition/binding. The peptide is synthesized in intrinsic cells of the corpus cardiacum as shown by in vitro incorporation of [3H]Trp and [14C]Tyr in Mem-CC.
