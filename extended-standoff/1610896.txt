Molecular cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of a cDNA clone encoding luciferase of a firefly, Luciola lateralis.
We have cloned a cDNA encoding Luciola lateralis (a common firefly in Japan) luciferase from a cDNA library of lantern poly(A)+ RNA, using a cDNA of L. cruciata (another common firefly in Japan) luciferase as a probe. The primary structure of L. lateralis luciferase deduced from the nucleotide sequence was shown to consist of 548 amino acids with a molecular weight of 60,132. Sequence comparison indicates that L. lateralis luciferase has significant sequence identity (94%) to L. cruciata luciferase, and that it has less sequence similarity (67%) to Photinus pyralis (a North American firefly) luciferase. The isolated cDNA clone, when introduced into Escherichia coli, directed the synthesis of enzymatically active luciferase under the control of the lacZ promoter.
