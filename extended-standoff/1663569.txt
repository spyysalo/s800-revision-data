Phylogenetic relationships of neopterygian fishes, inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequences.
To investigate the relationships among the three main groups of extant neopterygian fishes--Amiidae, Lepisosteidae, and Teleostei--we sequenced fragments of three mitochondrial genes from 12 different actinopterygian fishes and translated the nucleotide sequences into amino acid sequences. When all three regions are considered together, Amiidae clusters with Lepisosteidae in the most parsimonious cladograms, but other clades, such as Neopterygii and Teleostei, that are well supported by morphological evidence fail to emerge as monophyletic. When the cytochrome b sequences are analyzed together with previously published sequences for other taxa, the majority-rule consensus tree is consistent with the monophyly of Teleostei and Neopterygii and marginally supports the Amiidae + Lepisosteidae clade. In either analysis, when Neopterygii and Teleostei are constrained to monophyly, all the most-parsimonious cladograms support the Amiidae + Lepisosteidae topology. Where molecules and morphology disagree, provisional morphology-based constraints on the analysis of molecular data offer a practical means of integrating the two types of data.
