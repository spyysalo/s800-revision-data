A pyruvate-stimulated adenylate cyclase has a sequence related to the fes/fps oncogenes and to eukaryotic cyclases.
The pyruvate-stimulated adenylate cyclase from Brevibacterium liquefaciens produces up to 450 microM cyclic AMP in the culture medium when the bacterium is grown on glucose and alanine. In this paper we report the cloning, expression and sequencing of the gene for this enzyme. Residues were identified, within the C-terminal domain, which are conserved in adenylate and guanylate cyclase sequences from eukaryotes and in the adenylate cyclase of the prokaryote Rhizobium meliloti. We have also identified a sequence of 30 residues near the N-terminus of the protein which is homologous to part of the regulatory domain of the cellular homologues of the oncogenes fes and fps; this sequence is also present in the avian Fujinami sarcoma virus fps gene.
