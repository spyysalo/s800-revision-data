Maxadilan. Cloning and functional expression of the gene encoding this potent vasodilator peptide.
Maxadilan is a potent vasodilator peptide released into the skin when the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, an important vector of leishmania, probes for a blood meal. As several lines of evidence suggest that this peptide may play a critical role in the enhancement of leishmania infectivity attributed to sand fly saliva, the peptide has been proposed as a candidate antigen for a leishmanial vaccine. Although maxadilan is the most potent vasodilator peptide known and shares several properties with calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), studies of its structure, physiological effects, and biological roles have been limited by the miniscule quantities available. Here we report the isolation of cDNA and genomic DNA clones that encode maxadilan. The predicted translation product shows no significant homology with any previously isolated proteins. The coding DNA has been expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant peptide is biologically active with a specific activity comparable to the natural peptide. Recombinant maxadilan will be useful in studies of vascular biology and could lead to novel therapeutic and prophylactic agents.
