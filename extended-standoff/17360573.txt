Spliced leader RNA trans-splicing in dinoflagellates.
Through the analysis of hundreds of full-length cDNAs from fifteen species representing all major orders of dinoflagellates, we demonstrate that nuclear-encoded mRNAs in all species, from ancestral to derived lineages, are trans-spliced with the addition of the 22-nt conserved spliced leader (SL), DCCGUAGCCAUUUUGGCUCAAG (D = U, A, or G), to the 5' end. SL trans-splicing has been documented in a limited but diverse number of eukaryotes, in which this process makes it possible to translate polycistronically transcribed nuclear genes. In SL trans-splicing, SL-donor transcripts (SL RNAs) contain two functional domains: an exon that provides the SL for mRNA and an intron that contains a spliceosomal (Sm) binding site. In dinoflagellates, SL RNAs are unusually short at 50-60 nt, with a conserved Sm binding motif (AUUUUGG) located in the SL (exon) rather than the intron. The initiation nucleotide is predominantly U or A, an unusual feature that may affect capping, and hence the translation and stability of the recipient mRNA. The core SL element was found in mRNAs coding for a diverse array of proteins. Among the transcripts characterized were three homologs of Sm-complex subunits, indicating that the role of the Sm binding site is conserved, even if the location on the SL is not. Because association with an Sm-complex often signals nuclear import for U-rich small nuclear RNAs, it is unclear how this Sm binding site remains on mature mRNAs without impeding cytosolic localization or translation of the latter.
