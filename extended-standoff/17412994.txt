RNA4-encoded p31 of beet necrotic yellow vein virus is involved in efficient vector transmission, symptom severity and silencing suppression in roots.
RNA3 and RNA4 of beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) are not essential for virus multiplication, but are associated with vector-mediated infection and disease development in sugar beet roots. Here, a unique role for RNA4 in virus transmission, virulence and RNA silencing suppression was demonstrated. Mutagenic analysis revealed that the RNA4-encoded p31 open reading frame (ORF) was involved in efficient vector transmission and slight enhancement of symptom expression in some Beta species. No effects of RNA4 on virus accumulation in infected tissue were observed. Furthermore, the p31 ORF was involved in the induction of severe symptoms by BNYVV in Nicotiana benthamiana plants without affecting viral RNA accumulation. In contrast, RNA3-encoded p25, previously identified as a major contributor to symptom induction in sugar beet, had no such effect on N. benthamiana. In two different silencing suppression assays, neither p31 nor p25 was able to suppress RNA silencing in leaves, but the presence of p31 enhanced a silencing suppressor activity in roots without alteration in viral RNA accumulation. Thus, BNYVV p31 plays a multifunctional role in efficient vector transmission, enhanced symptom expression and root-specific silencing suppression.
