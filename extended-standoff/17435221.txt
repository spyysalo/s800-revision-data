The bursicon gene in mosquitoes: an unusual example of mRNA trans-splicing.
The bursicon gene in Anopheles gambiae is encoded by two loci. Burs124 on chromosome arm 2L contains exons 1, 2, and 4, while burs3 on arm 2R contains exon 3. Exon 3 is efficiently spliced into position in the mature transcript. This unusual gene arrangement is ancient within mosquitoes, being shared by Aedes aegypti and Culex pipiens.
