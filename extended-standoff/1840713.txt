Nucleotide sequence and coding capacity of the large (L) genomic RNA segment of Seoul 80-39 virus, a member of the hantavirus genus.
The nucleotide sequence of the large (L) genomic RNA segment of Seoul 80-39 virus was determined from overlapping cDNA clones. The virion L RNA segment is 6530 nucleotides long. The 3' and 5' terminal sequences are inversely complementary for 15 bases. The viral complementary-sense RNA contains a single open reading frame from an AUG codon at nucleotide position 37-39 to a UAA stop codon at nucleotide position 6490-6492. This ORF could encode a polypeptide of 2151 amino acids (246,662 kDa) which likely corresponds to the L protein detected in purified viral particles (Elliott et al., 1984) and is assumed to be an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase molecule (Schmaljohn and Dalrymple, 1983). Comparison of the L protein of the Seoul 80-39 virus with the polymerase proteins encoded by other negative-stranded RNA viruses revealed 44% similarity only with the part of the Bunyamwera virus L protein (Elliott, 1989) and a very weak homology with the PB1 protein of influenza virus.
