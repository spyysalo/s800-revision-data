Cloning, sequencing and expression of the glutamine synthetase structural gene (glnA) from the obligate methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath).
The structural gene (glnA) encoding the ammonia-assimulation enzyme glutamine synthetase (GS) has been cloned from the obligate methanotroph Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Complementation of Escherichia coli glnA mutants was demonstrated. In vitro expression analysis revealed that the cloned glnA gene coded for a polypeptide of apparent Mr 60,000, as determined by PAGE. Expression of the M. capsulatus (Bath) glnA gene in E. coli was regulated by nitrogen levels in an Ntr+ but not an Ntr- background. The nucleotide sequence of the M. capsulatus (Bath) glnA gene and flanking sequences was determined. This gene, of 1407 bp, encoded a polypeptide of Mr 51717 containing 468 amino acids. The 5' leader region contained three putative promoters. Promoters P1 and P3 resembled the canonical -10 -35 E. coli-type promoter. Promoter P2, which was located between P1 and P3, resembled the NtrA-dependent promoters of enteric organisms. A potential NtrC-binding site was also determined, flanking the Pribnow box at P1. Comparisons of nucleotide-derived amino acid sequences of GS enzymes from prokaryotes and eukaryotes with GS from M. capsulatus are made.
