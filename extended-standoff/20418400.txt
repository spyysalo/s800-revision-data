Genome sequences of Oceanicola granulosus HTCC2516(T) and Oceanicola batsensis HTCC2597(TDelta).
Genome sequences from the prolific Roseobacter clade in the Alphaproteobacteria are beginning to reveal the genetic basis for the diverse lifestyles of these organisms. Here we present the genome sequences of Oceanicola granulosus HTCC2516(T) and Oceanicola batsensis HTCC2597(T), two marine Roseobacter species isolated from the Sargasso Sea using dilution-to-extinction culturing, whose genomes encode for significant differences in metabolic potential.
