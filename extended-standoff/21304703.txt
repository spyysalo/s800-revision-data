Complete genome sequence of Segniliparus rotundus type strain (CDC 1076).
Segniliparus rotundus Butler 2005 is the type species of the genus Segniliparus, which is currently the only genus in the corynebacterial family Segniliparaceae. This family is of large interest because of a novel late-emerging genus-specific mycolate pattern. The type strain has been isolated from human sputum and is probably an opportunistic pathogen. Here we describe the features of this organism, together with the complete genome sequence and annotation. This is the first completed genome sequence of the family Segniliparaceae. The 3,157,527 bp long genome with its 3,081 protein-coding and 52 RNA genes is part of the Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea project.
