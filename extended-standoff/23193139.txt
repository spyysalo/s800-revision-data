Draft genome sequence of Wickerhamomyces ciferrii NRRL Y-1031 F-60-10.
Wickerhamomyces ciferrii is a microorganism characterized by the production and secretion of large amounts of acetylated sphingoid bases, in particular tetraacetyl phytosphingosine. Here, we present the 15.90-Mbp draft genome sequence of W. ciferrii NRRL Y-1031 F-60-10 generated by pyrosequencing and de novo assembly. The draft genome sequence comprising 364 contigs in 150 scaffolds was annotated and covered 6,702 protein-coding sequences. This information will contribute to the metabolic engineering of this yeast to improve the yield and spectrum of acetylated sphingoid bases in biotechnological production.
