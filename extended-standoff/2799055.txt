[Changes in uric acid and blood lipids in patients with asymptomatic hyperuricemia treated with diet therapy in a rehabilitation procedure].
More than 300 patients with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia had been included in lipometabolic analysis performed before and after 4 weeks of a special low-cholesterol, low-triglyceride and low-purine dietetic regimen. Remarkable in almost the entire hyperuricaemic population (96.7%) had been the presence of serum cholesterol levels of more than 200 mg/dl. Lipoprotein analysis showed that 87% of the patients had increased LDL- and 69% increased VLDL-levels; HDL-levels were pathologically lowered to below 40mg/dl in 41% of the group. After a four-week rehabilitation programme, all lipometabolic parameters and serum urate concentrations were found to have been significantly reduced by the special diet. The results therefore are impressive proof of the major health benefits of purposive nutritional behaviour.
