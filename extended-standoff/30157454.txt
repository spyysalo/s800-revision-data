Functional characterization of the uracil transporter from honeybee pathogen Paenibacillus larvae.
The genome of the Honeybee bacterial pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae, encodes for protein a with substantial amino acid sequence similarity to the canonical Escherichia coli uracil transporter UraA. P. larvae expresses the uracil permease (PlUP) locus, and is sensitive to the presence of the toxic uracil analog 5-fluorouracil under vegetative growth conditions. The solute transport and binding profile of PlUP was determined by radiolabeled uptake experiments via heterologous expression in nucleobase transporter-deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains. PlUP is specific for the transport of uracil and competitively binds xanthine and uric acid. Further biochemical characterization reveals that PlUP has a strong affinity for uracil with a Km 19.5 ± 1.6 μM. Uracil transport is diminished in the presence of the proton disruptor carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, but not by the sodium gradient disruptor Ouabain.
