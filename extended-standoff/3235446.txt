Complete amino acid sequence of ferredoxin from Peridinium bipes (Dinophyceae).
The amino acid sequence of the major ferredoxin component isolated from a dinoflagellate, Peridinium bipes, was completely determined. Staphylococcus aureus V8 proteolytic, tryptic and chymotryptic peptides of Cm-ferredoxin were prepared and sequenced. The sequence was Phe-Lys-Val-Thr-Leu-Asp-Thr-Pro-Asp-Gly-Lys-Lys-Ser-Phe-Glu-Cys- Pro-Gly-Asp-Ser-Tyr-Ile-Leu-Asp-Lys-Ala-Glu-Glu-Glu-Gly-Leu-Glu-Leu-Pro- Tyr-Ser - Cys-Arg-Ala-Gly-Ser-Cys-Ser-Ser-Cys-Ala-Gly-Lys-Val-Leu-Thr-Gly-Ser-Ile- Asp-Gln - Ser-Asp-Gln-Ala-Phe-Leu-Asp-Asp-Asp-Gln-Gly-Gly-Asp-Gly-Tyr-Cys-Leu-Thr- Cys-Val - Thr-Tyr-Pro-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val-Thr-Ile-Lys-Thr-His-Cys-Glu-Ser-Glu-Leu. It was composed of 93 amino acid residues with 7 cysteine residues, the highest number found among the chloroplast-type ferredoxins so far sequenced. A cysteine residue was found for the first time at the 89th position in a chloroplast-type ferredoxin. Calculation of the numbers of amino acid differences among chloroplast-type ferredoxins indicates that the Peridinium ferredoxin is far divergent not only from higher plant ferredoxins but also from blue-green algal ferredoxins.
