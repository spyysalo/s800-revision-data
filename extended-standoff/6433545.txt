Glicentin-containing cells in intestinal metaplasia, adenoma and carcinoma of the stomach.
Glicentin-containing cells (Glic. cells) in intestinal metaplasia, adenoma and carcinoma of the stomach were examined using immuno-histochemical techniques. Glic. cells first occurred in the gastric mucosa of the transitional area between metaplastic and intact gastric glands. They frequently showed hyperplasia or micronoduli in the budding area of the deeper metaplastic glands, but in completely intestinalized mucosa these endocrine cells decreased remarkably. Gastric adenomas with mild dysplasia had a good number of glicentin-immunoreactive cells which were located in the deeper adenoma glands. Gastrin- and somatostatin-positive cells were also detected in the adenomas. The incidence of glicentin-positive tumor cells was significantly higher in well differentiated adenocarcinoma than in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Among the seven cases of scirrhous argyrophil cell carcinoma, three showed glicentin- and glucagon-immunoreactivity in the same area of the tumor. These findings suggest that the selective increase of Glic. cells in intestinal metaplasia may be closely related to the development of gastric adenoma. Glicentin positive tumor cells in gastric carcinomas can be regarded to be an expression of intestinal or fetal markers.
