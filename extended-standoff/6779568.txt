Air esophagram after laryngectomy.
Air in the esophagus is frequently visible on chest radiographs of patients who have undergone laryngectomy (15/30; 50%). It is more frequently seen in those who successfully use esophageal speech (11/18; 61%) than in those who do not (4/12; 33%). The esophagus may be dilated, totally air filled, and contain an air-fluid level. A discussion of the physiology of esophageal speech and a differential diagnosis of esophageal air are presented. An air esophagram in patients using esophageal speech after laryngectomy in the absence of symptoms of an obstructing lesion should not be considered abnormal.
