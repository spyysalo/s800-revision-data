[Possibilities of helium-neon lasers in olfactory disorders].
310 patients with olfactory analyzer dysfunction have been examined. Of them 40 patients received laser radiation on the olfactory zone. The course comprised 10 sessions. A response occurred in 26 patients who exhibited neither side effects nor allergy. The conclusion is made on validity of using helium-neon laser in perspective olfactory defects.
