Cyanidium caldarium genes encoding subunits A and B of V-ATPase.
The genes encoding subunits A and B of V-ATPase in Cyanidium caldarium were cloned and sequenced. While the gene encoding subunit A is not interrupted by introns, the gene encoding subunit B contains seven introns ranging from 36 to 60 nucleotides.
