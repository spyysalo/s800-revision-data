Molecular phylogeny of families related to Celastrales based on rbcL 5' flanking sequences.
The region between the rbcL and atpB chloroplast genes and the first 53 codons of the rbcL gene have been sequenced for 19 species of angiosperms. Nine of these belong to the four largest families within the order Celastrales sensu Cronquist (i.e., Aquifoliaceae s.l., Icacinaceae, Celastraceae, and Hippocrateaceae). Both phenetic and cladistic approaches were used to test the monophyly of the order and to specify its relationships with Euphorbiaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rosaceae, and Theaceaea. Based upon this molecular analysis, the order Celastrales is polyphyletic and is divided into two major clades. The first group, containing Aquifoliaceae s.l. and Icacina, is related to Camellia (Theaceae). The second, containing Euonymus (Celastraceae), Hippocratea, and Salacia (Hippocrateaceae), is related to Euphorbia (Euphorbiaceae).
