Molecular phylogeny of the Anopheles gambiae complex suggests genetic introgression between principal malaria vectors.
The six Afrotropical species of mosquitoes comprising the Anopheles gambiae complex include the most efficient vectors of malaria in the world as well as a nonvector species. The accepted interpretation of evolutionary relationships among these species is based on chromosomal inversions and suggests that the two principal vectors, A. gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis, are on distant branches of the phylogenetic tree. However, DNA sequence data indicate that these two species are sister taxa and suggest gene flow between them. These results have important implications for malaria control strategies involving the replacement of vector with nonvector populations.
