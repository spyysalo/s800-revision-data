The gene for ribosomal protein L27 is located on the plastid rather than the nuclear genome of the chlorophyll c-containing alga Pleurochrysis carterae.
The gene for ribosomal protein L27 (rpl27) has not been found in plastid genomes. We report here that the rpl27 gene is located in the plastid genome of the prymnesiophyte Pleurochrysis carterae. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 59% identity with E. coli L27. 1.0 kb transcript of the gene was detected by Northern blot analysis. Nucleotide sequence analysis of PCR products suggested that rpl27 is widespread in the genomes of Prymesiophyta and Rhodophyta. In all species of Prymnesiophyta examined in this study, the gene is located at the 3' downstream region of Rubisco operon.
