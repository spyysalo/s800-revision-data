Phylogenetic relationships among the major lineages of the birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae) using mitochondrial DNA gene sequences.
Complete mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences were determined from 12 species of the Australo-Papuan birds-of-paradise (Paradisaeidae) representing 9 genera. Phylogenetic analysis of these and 5 previously published sequences reveals a radiation of the main paradisaeinine lineages that took place over a relatively short evolutionary time scale. The core paradisaeinines are resolved as the monophyletic sister-group to the crow-like manucodines. The genus Parotia is basal to other paradisaeinines and is not closely related to the morphologically similar genera Ptiloris and Lophorina. Three major clades within the paradisaeinine ingroup include: (1) Cicinnurus and Diphyllodes, (2) Ptiloris and Lophorina, and (3) the genus Paradisaea. The monotypic genus Seleucidis is apparently closely related to clades (1) and (2). Cytochrome b sequences did not provide evidence for the monophyly of the sicklebill genera Epimachus and Drepanornis. The paradisaeid tree is characterized by short internodal distances. Thus, some clades cannot be strongly resolved by cytochrome b sequences alone.
